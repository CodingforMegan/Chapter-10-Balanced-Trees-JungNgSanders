# üõ†Ô∏è Objective:

- Explore AVL and Red-Black Trees.
- Implement basic AVL and Red-Black Trees in Python.
- Compare performance and balancing operations between the two structures.
- Reflect on design choices through coding, visualization, and analysis.

# üßπ Lab

## Part 1: AVL Tree Implementation
- Implement a basic AVL Tree class in Python.
- Support insertion with rebalancing (rotations).
- Include tree printing (simple text output or graphic).
- Real-life scenario to model with your AVL Tree:  
    ? Managing player rankings in a competitive video game leaderboard.
    ? Organizing inventory stock numbers for a warehouse.
    ? Scheduling patient appointments by appointment ID.

## Part 2: Red-Black Tree Implementation
- Implement a Red-Black Tree class in Python.
- Support insertion with recoloring and rotation as needed.
- Include tree printing (simple text output or graphic).
- Choose one real-life scenario to model with your Red-Black Tree:
    ? Storing and updating book ISBN numbers in a library database.
    ? Maintaining sorted event timestamps for a server log.
    ? Managing airline flight numbers for efficient look-up and updates.

## Part 3: Comparison and Analysis
- Insert the same set of 20 random integers into both trees.
- Track and report:
      a. Number of rotations
      b. Final tree heights
      c. Summarize key differences observed between the AVL and Red-Black trees.
